# Budget-App
A personal app for keeping track of income and expenses!

The app will keep a list of incomes and expenses under their respective tabs, and the user can toggle between the tabs. Users can enter, edit, and delete income and expense inputs. The top portion of the app displays total income, total outcome, and overall balance.

This project was inspired by a Code Explained tutorial (https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Budget-App-JavaScript)
